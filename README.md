# southern_water_corp

I worked on a case study to help Southern Water Corp understand the anomalies of their pumping operations and predict potential pump failures in their operations. 

The following tools and libraries were used during my analysis: 
- Excel
- Python
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Statsmodels  

For further details on my analysis, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook in this repository.
